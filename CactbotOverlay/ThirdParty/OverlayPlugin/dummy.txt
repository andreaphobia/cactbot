This directory is for DLLs from ngld's OverlayPlugin.

Download from: https://github.com/ngld/OverlayPlugin/releases

It needs to be installed and enabled in ACT, as per https://github.com/ngld/OverlayPlugin/blob/master/README-en.md

Extract the contents of the release into this file,
such that OverlayPlugin.dll is in the base
CactbotOverlay\ThirdParty\OverlayPlugin directory
with libs\ subdirectories, etc.

It's intended that cactbot developers could potentially load
the this from their CactbotOverlay\ThirdParty\OverlayPlugin
directory, so that future updates will auto update it properly.
